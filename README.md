This repository contains the source code and documentation for a line-following robot project. The robot is designed to autonomously follow a predefined path from 
Point A to Point B and return using sensors and embedded systems.
Features:
Autonomous Navigation: The robot can navigate along a predefined path using infrared sensors.
Path Memorization: Capable of memorizing a random path from Point A to Point B.
Wireless Data Transmission: The robot wirelessly transmits data to a central station for monitoring.
